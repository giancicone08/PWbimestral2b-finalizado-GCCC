    <h1>Create user interfaces <br> from components</h1>
    <p>React lets you build user interfaces out of individual
         pieces called components. <br> Create your own React 
         components like Thumbnail, LikeButton, and Video. <br>
          Then combine them into entire screens, pages, 
          and apps. <br>
    </p>

    <p>Whether you work on your 
        own or with thousands of 
        other developers, using  <br>
        React feels the same. 
        It is designed to let 
        you seamlessly combine 
        components <br> written by 
        independent people, teams, 
        and organizations.
    </p>

<section id="s3" class="CC">
    <h1>Write components<br> with code and markup</h1>
    <p>React components are JavaScript functions. 
        Want to show some content<br> conditionally?
         Use an if statement. Displaying a list? 
         Try array map(). Learning <br>React is learning programming.
    </p>
    <img src="img/videoList.jss.png" alt="">
    <img src="img/3.videos.png" alt="">
    <p>This markup syntax is called JSX. It is a JavaScript
        syntax extension popularized<br> by React. Putting JSX
         markup close to related rendering logic makes React<br>
          components easy to create, maintain, and delete.

    <h1>Add interactivity<br> wherever you need it</h1>
    <p>React components receive data and return what should appear on
        the screen.<br> You can pass them new data in response
         to an interaction, like when the user <br>types into an input.
          React will then update the screen to match the new data.<br>

    <p>You dont have to build your whole page in React. Add React to your 
        existing<br> HTML page, and render interactive React 
        components anywhere on it.<br></p>

    <h1>Go full-stack<br>
        with a framework</h1>
    <p>React is a library. It lets you put components together,
         but it doesnt prescribe<br> how to do routing and data fetching. 
         To build an entire app with React, we <br>recommend a full-stack 
         React framework like Next.js or Remix.<br>
    </p>
    <img src="img/confs.png" alt="">
    <img src="img/react.conf.2021.png" alt="">
    <p>React is also an architecture. Frameworks that implement it 
        let you fetch data in <br>asynchronous components that run on 
        the server or even during the build. Read<br> data from a file
         or a database, and pass it down to your interactive components.<br>

    <h1>Use the best from <br>every platform</h1>
    <p>People love web and native apps for different reasons. 
        React lets you build both <br>web apps and native apps using
         the same skills. It leans upon each platform’s <br>unique 
         strengths to let your interfaces feel just right on 
         every platform.<br>
    </p>

    <p>With React, you can be a web and a native developer.
        Your team can ship to many<br> platforms without sacrificing
         the user experience. Your organization can bridge<br> the 
         platform silos, and form teams that own entire features
          end-to-end.<br>

            surfaces with over<br> a billion users. Over 100,000
            React components at<br> Meta help validate every migration
            strategy.<br> The React team is always researching how to 
            improve<br> React. Some research takes years to pay off. 
            React has<br> a high bar for taking a research idea into 
            production.<br> Only proven approaches become a part of

    <p> This is why React is more than a library,
         an architecture, or even an ecosystem. <br>
         React is a community. It’s a place where
          you can ask for help, find opportunities,<br>
           and meet new friends. You will meet both
            developers and designers, beginners<br> and
             experts, researchers and artists, teachers
              and students. Our backgrounds<br> may be very 
              different, but React lets us all create user
               interfaces together.<br>
